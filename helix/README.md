## features:

6 separate pages.

7 loop rows, each with a loop clear, stop, rewind and stop, mute, pitch bend mute, scale mute and record function.

midi out channel select for each loop.

loop "multiply" select. multiply any of the 7 loops by the total millesecond length of the first loop. for example: you record the second loop, but you're a few milliseconds off, just select "1" and the loop will cut to 1 x the length of the first loop. 

scale select - constrain your loop to one of 8 scales set up in the app. 

midi program out select for each loop. 

pitch select for each loop.

save scenes for pitch, scale, midi channels, program out and loop multiply to file.

save loops to file and load 'em later.

note: the download includes certain necessary abstractions.
