# Sleep

Sleep is a generative simulation

**Created by:** tehn

**Prefix:** run monomeserial concurrently with prefix set to /sleep

**Long description:** The two fifty six runs this simulation when powered but not plugged into the computer.

Like conway’s game of life but with probabilities and sound reminiscent of the apple2. Parameters change depending on the total population — a gradual rise and decline takes place over time.
