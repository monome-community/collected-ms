## Description

The main goal is to facilitate Monome programming by manipulating simple virtual entities like leds, buttons, analogs, groups of leds and buttons, sequencers, frames, etc... You don't need to know the OSC protocol at all.

SkyMonome can manage knobs or accelerometers soldered on the Monome board. Its API is as modular as possible. Possible applications are graphical (clocks, vu-meters, spectral analyzers,...), musical (simple or very elaborated sequencers, beat mappers, Midi controllers,...).
