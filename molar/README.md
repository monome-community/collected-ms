Plug in for the monome with audio abilities.
Molar is an extended version of the MonoChrome plugin.  Both plugins allow you to sync to host tempo and generate MIDI sequences of notes, or use your Monome like a MIDI keyboard.

However Molar also allows you to load AudioFiles as loops or one-shot, and/or capture/manipulate a live Audio Input signal.
