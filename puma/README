DEPENDENCIES

	Very few dependencies needed. At the least you will need mrpeach 
	for the OSC objects. That's it!
	If you have Pd-extended it is already installed. Just make sure 
	there is a path pointing at it in the preferences.

INSTALL:

	To ease the use of the library, you should place it anywhere
	convenient for you (inside [path-to-pd/extra] is a good idea) and 
	add a path inside the preferences of Pd to point to the puma folder.
