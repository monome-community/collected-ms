Two keyboards with velocity control and an octave selector.

The monome is split into two halves, both function in the same way. Row one is a slider which allows you to select the desired octave of the keyboard. Row two is another slider but this one determines the velocity of all the notes on the keyboard. The last two rows are layed out in a way in which i think best represents a standard keyboard.

Thanks to jimdrake for the monomecontrol objects which have helped a lot here and allowed me to throw this together real quick.
