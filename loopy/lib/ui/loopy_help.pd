#X text 350 -33 *****************;
#X text -763 -46 Bongo;
#X text -762 -13 loopy is a Pure Data based sample player for use with
a monome combining the large sample bank capabilities of 64 Fingers
with simple mlr-like sample cutting.;
#X text -763 59 - IF AT ANY TIME YOU WANT TO STOP ALL SOUND \, CLICK
THE BUTTON ON THE MAIN loopy SCREEN WHERE IT SAYS 'click to stop all
samples/recorders.';
#X text -763 384 INTRODUCTION;
#X text -763 394 ************;
#X text -763 475 - 56 individual samples can be loaded into a grid
of 7 rows by 8 columns. The top-most row on the monome (row 0) is used
for paging and for pattern recorders. Pattern recorders can record
button presses or audio.;
#X text -764 524 - Each row can be set to play in "multiple \, " "single
\, " or "cue" row mode (defined below). Settings for each row can also
set each sample in the row to play in "momentary \, " "trigger" or
"loop" sample mode and to control quantization (also defined below).
Sample mode and quantization can also be set for each sample individually
to override row settings.;
#X text -763 606 - A sample bank and associated settings can be saved
and recalled at the row level. A global save and load capability stores
all samples and settings for all rows.;
#X text -764 124 - Select monome layout (64 or 128) on the main loopy
screen.;
#X text -763 140 - Click to send prefix setting to monomeserial (prefix
is /loopy) on the main loopy screen.;
#X text -763 167 - Click 'load' to select audio file for sample 0 in
row 1 on main loopy screen.;
#X text -764 194 - Press and hold leftmost button on second row of
monome to begin playback. release button to stop.;
#X text -762 303 - Tap buttons in second row to cut sample to play
from different points within the sample.;
#X text -763 404 - loopy is best used with a monome 128 in horizontal
orientation \, but can be used with a 64 as well. When used with a
128 \, the left half is used for the sample bank and the right half
for sample cutting. When used with a 64 \, the top left button is used
to toggle between two "pages \, " one for the sample bank and the other
for sample cutting.;
#X text -763 678 - The loopy on-screen interface is used to load and
save settings and samples \, and to set row modes \, sample modes and
quantization.;
#X text -763 716 - Selecting and triggering samples to play is done
from the monome itself \, though the on-screen interface simulates
Monome LEDs by displaying selected samples and a progression across
8 steps of sample playback location.;
#X text -390 -43 PAGE LEFT/RIGHT;
#X text -390 -33 ***************;
#X text -390 -23 For purposes of simplifying the rest of this help
file \, reference will be made to the left or right side of the monome.
For a horizontally oriented monome 128 this will refer to the left
(columns 0-7) and right (columns 8-15) half of the monome grid. For
a monome 64 \, the top left button is used to toggle between the left
side (led off) and right side (led on).;
#X text -390 73 ROW MODE;
#X text -390 83 ********;
#X text -390 93 For loopy sample rows - rows 1 thru 7 - each row can
operate in one of three row modes:;
#X text -390 131 In multi-mode \, the left- and right-side butttons
function identically \; When a button is pushed in plays the associated
sample according to the sample mode (momentary \, trigger or loop -
see below for more on this). Multiple samples can be playing at once
in this mode. This is similar to the operation of the 64 fingers application.
;
#X text -390 223 In single-mode \, the left side buttons are used to
select a sample to be played \, while the right side buttons can be
used to cut samples like mlr. Samples play according to the sample
mode (momentary \, trigger or loop - see below). Only one sample at
a time can be selected on the left side. Pressing a sample button on
the left immediately starts sample play. Pressing a button on the right
plays the sample from the relative position associated with the button
position (e.g. 1st button plays from beginning \, 5th button starts
play from 5/8ths of the way thru the sample).;
#X text -390 349 In cue-mode \, similar to single mode \, the left
side buttons are used to select a sample to be played \, while the
right side buttons can be used to cut samples like mlr and samples
play according to sample mode. The difference from single mode is that
pushing a sample button on the left side only cues that sample to be
played but does not start playing it. In this way \, while one sample
is playing \, another can be cued to play next. The sample cued on
the left side only plays once a sample cutting button is pressed o
the right side.;

is tapped. Sample stops when left-side button is tapped again \, or
when another left-side button is tapped (which will stop the sample
that had been playing and start playing the newly tapped one).;
#X text -20 591 * cue-mode - If a sample is selected on the left-side
\, sample plays from corresponding position when right-side button
is pressed \, continuing to loop until a) the left-side button is tapped
again \, resulting in no sample playing for this row \; or b) another
left-side sample button is tapped AND then a right-side button is tapped
\, resulting in a stop for the previous sample and playing of the newly
selected sample.;

#X text 350 136 To reset a pattern recorder \, tap the pattern recorder
button twice quickly \, and the previously recorded pattern will stop
playing and the LED will go off \, indicating readiness to record.
As above \, tap once to enter record mode.;
#X text 350 200 RECORDER SETTINGS: All recorder settings can be set
individually or by changing master settings for all recorders.;
#X text 351 424 In 'Audio all rows' mode \, recording begins with the
first button press following record mode \, and all audio playing will
be recorded as an audio file \, stopping after the selected number
of beats \, when all sample playback is stopped. Playback begins automatically
\, but is playing back the recorded audio file and is independent of
buttons pressed thereafter on the monome.;
#X text 351 307 In 'Buttons' mode \, only button presses which occur
after recording has begun are recorded. Any samples already playing
when recording begins continue playing but do not effect the recording.
Playback begins automatically when the recording is finished and behaves
as if buttons are being pressed on the monome.;
#X text 351 510 In 'Audio row n' mode \, recording begins with the
first button press in the particular row being recorded following record
mode \, all audio playing in the particular row will be recorded as
an audio file \, stopping after the selected number of beats \, when
sample playback in that row only is stopped. Playback begins automatically
\, but is playing back the recorded audio file and is independent of
samples already playing in other rows or buttons pressed thereafter
on the monome.;
#X text 351 748 * Length - Recording length in beats is set by clicking
\, and toggles 1-2-4-8-16-32-64 beats. Clcik slowly \, as this change
takes a little time.;

file \, stopping after the selected number of beats. Playback begins
automatically \, but is playing back the recorded audio file and is
independent of any samples already playing or buttons pressed thereafter
on the monome. Up to 8 external audio channels may be available for
recording \, depending on your system and sound card/device. The two
numbers after recorder input and before # of beats on the UI define
which external audio channels go to the left and right channels of
the recorder.;
#X text 351 232 * Input - Recorders can be set to record button presses
from all rows (Buttons) \, button presses only for the row number =
the recorder number (Button row n) \, all internal audio (Audio all
rows) \, audio only for the row number = the recorder number (Audio
row n) \, or external audio (Audio external). Click input source to
toggle.;
#X text 351 382 'Button row n' mode (e.g. Button row 3) is similar
to 'Buttons' mode \, except that only button presses in the specificed
