_pd_mlr_0.61 Release Notes

Fixed in this release

1) Fixed bug in V0.6 release. I had neglected to reset the auto load feature, and V0.6 was trying to auto load a set from a location on my own PC.

_pd_mlr_0.6 Release Notes

Fixed in this release

1) Replaced dumpOSC/sendOSC, which is no longer supported, with Mr Peach external for OSC communication with monome.



_pd_mlr_0.5 Release Notes


Fixed in this release:

1) Added missing functionality - Changing master tempo or standard beats per sample now changes playback speed of all samples.

2) Fixed bug where chopping between different sample rows assigned to the same group caused a brief discontinuity audible as click or silence - Now cross-fades correctly.

3) Improved functionality of audio loop recorders - a) Implemented a cross-fade between end and beginning of loop; and b) Adjusted precise timing of loop record start/stop for better capture of what exactly what is heard while recording.

4) Fixed bug where group stop was being sent to rows without samples loaded, causing clicks.

5) Fixed bug where "stop all samples" did not always work.

6) Added functionality to save sample play direction (forward/reverse) in saved set.


Under consideration for future releases:

1) Add functionality for next/previous preset settings, to make it easy to move between sample sets/settings directly from the monome during performance.

2) Consider revising interface for sequence recorders, as current quick double press of button used to reset recorder can sometimes result in a brief bit of unwanted play of previously recorded loop.
