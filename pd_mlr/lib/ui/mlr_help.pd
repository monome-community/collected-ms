#X text -763 -37 - Ben (ucacjbs on monome board) for his Tutorial:
a basic MLR in PD \, in turn inspired by smioliolio's max mlr tutorial
\, from which I learned the pd phasor object approach to sample cutting
used here \, as well as a number of other techniques. See:;
#X text -763 51 - Scott (BoxieBrown on monome board) for his review
and suggestions for improvement.;
#X text -763 83 - And of course Tehn for the origianl mlr.;
#X text -763 -103 THANKS TO:;
#X text -763 -93 **********;
#X text -763 117 QUICK START;
#X text -763 127 ***********;
#X text -763 137 - select monome layout;
#X text -763 147 - click to send prefix setting to monomeserial (prefix
is /pd_mlr);
#X text -763 167 - click 'load' to select audio file for top left sample
row (#1);
#X text -763 187 - press leftmost button on second row of monome to
begin playback;
#X text -763 237 ON-SCREEN INTERFACE;
#X text -763 247 *******************;
#X text -763 257 The pd_mlr on-screen interface is fully functional
without using a monome \, though its use is intended for setup and
testing rather than performance. Various on-screen settings are explained
below.;
#X text -763 307 Monome button presses are simulated by clicking a
toggle box on-screen - clicking once toggles on \, corresponding to
a monome button value of '1' \, and clicking again toggles off \, corresponding
to a monome button press of '0'.;
#X text -763 357 Monome LEDs are simulated on-screen by lighting purple
behind the toggle box.;
#X text 20 -143 CONFIGURATION SETTINGS;
#X text 20 -133 **********************;
#X text 19 -123 Mixer - Set volume levels for 4 or 8 groups and master
volume. The number of group volume controls displayed depends on the
monome layout selected.;
#X text 20 -81 BPM - Set beats-per-minute tempo by clicking -4/-1/+1/+4.
This setting will affect quantization \, calculated beats per sample
\, and length of pattern recorders.;
#X text 20 85 Quantize - Set quantize rate for monome button press
input. 1/4 = 1 beat. Each monome button press in a sample row is held
until the next quantum comes around. For example \, if quantize is
set to 1/4 \, a button press is held until the next beat \, whereas
if quantize is set to 1/16 \, a button press is held until the next
quarter beat.;
#X text 20 -39 Std Beats - Set standard beats \, used to set each loaded
sample to nearest multiple of standard beats.;
#X text 40 -8 sample beats = round [(original sample length (ms) /
std beats (ms)] * std beats;
#X text 40 24 sample speed = original sample length (ms) / (sample
beats * ms per beat);
#X text 40 54 current sample length = original sample length (ms) /
sample speed;
#X text 20 153 MicroFade - Set time (ms) of volume fade out/fade in
cross-fade when cutting or switching samples.;
#X text -370 -143 SAMPLE CONTROLS;
#X text -370 -133 ***************;
#X text -370 -123 load - Click to bring up open file dialog to select
sample for this row.;
#X text -370 -93 clear - Clear sample file and all settings for this
row.;
#X text -370 -73 stop - Stop sample play from the on-screen interface.
Current sample remains loaded and settings are maintained.;
#X text -370 -43 forward/reverse - Clicking on >F> will toggle to <R<
and vice versa \, causing the sample to play forward or in reverse.
;
#X text -370 37 beats - When sample is loaded \, beats are calculated
automatically as the nearest multiple of standard beats (see standard
beats definition above). Speed is then calculated & set to adjust length
of sample to this calculated number of beats. Beats can be increased/decreased
by clicking +/-. This will change the speed and pitch proportionally.
If speed is changed directly (see speed definition next) \, Changing
beats thereafter will restore the beat & speed relationship to standard
beats.;
#X text -370 157 speed - Playback speed is set when sample is loaded
(see beats definition previous). Speed can be changed manually by clicking
on the value and dragging up/down to increase/decrease. Doing so "breaks"
the beat & speed relationship to standard beats.;
#X text -762 399 GROUP CONTROLS;
#X text -762 409 **************;
#X text -370 239 RECORDER CONTROLS;
#X text -370 249 *****************;
#X text -370 259 The rightmost 4 (64 or 128V) or 8 (128H or 256) buttons
in the top row represent pattern recorders 1-4 or 1-8 \, respectively.
;
#X text -370 352 Playback begins automatically and immediately after
the recording is finished \, and the pattern recorder button will flash
"long on-short off." Tapping the pattern recorder button will toggle
to stop playing and the pattern recorder button will flash "short on-long
off." Short taps will continue to toggle between play/stop.;
#X text -370 479 Set recording length in beats with the purple slider.
;
#X text -370 499 Click to toggle B/A to record button presses (B) or
audio (A).;
#X text -370 529 In button press mode \, only button presses which
occur after recording has begun are recorded. Any samples already playing
when recording begins continue playing but do not effect the recording.
Playback begins automatically when the recording is finished and behaves
as if buttons are being pressed on the monome.;
#X text 20 187 Monome layout - Click on the desired monome layout -
64 \, 128H (horizontal) \, 128V (vertical) or 256 Selection determines
sample rows shown \, as well as the number of groups and pattern recorders
available.;
#X text 21 231 64 & 128V provide 4 groups + 4 recorders \; 128H & 256
provide 8 groups + 8 recorders.;
#X text 20 348 Auto-Load Set - Click to toggle ON/OFF. Setting to 'ON'
will cause the sample set last saved to the pd_mlr Config file to be
automatically loaded when pd_mlr application is launched. (see Save
Current Config below);
#X text 20 401 Click to stop all samples - sends stop to every sample
row.;
#X text 20 411 Click to clear all LEDs - clears all monome/on-screen
LEDs.;
#X text 20 421 Click to clear all samples - sends clear to every sample
row.;
#X text 20 451 Auto-Set Prefix - Click to toggle ON/OFF. Setting to
'ON' will cause the monomeserial prefix of /pd_mlr to be set automatically
when pd_mlr application is launched.;
#X text 20 554 pd_mlr_brain - Click this box to open up all of the
pd patches which comprise pd_mlr.;
#X text -763 -166 3 Feb 2010;
#X text -763 -176 Bongo;
#X text -762 -143 pd_mlr is a sample-cutting application for use with
a monome written in Pure Data (extended version required).;
#X text -762 419 The leftmost 4 (64 or 128V) or 8 (128H or 256) buttons
in the top row represent groups 0-3 or 0-7 \, respectively. Only one
sample can play in a given group \, and choosing a sample in a group
will cancel another sample playing in the same group. The group LED
lights if a sample in the group is playing. Tap the group button to
stop all samples in the group and clear the group LED.;
#X text -370 -3 group - Map sample to group 0-3 (64 or 128V) or 0-7
(128H or 256) by clicking in appropriate box (0-leftmost to 3/7-rightmost).
;
#X text 20 491 Configuration Save Current - Click to save all current
configuration settings \, including BPM \, Std Beats \, Quantize \,
MicroFade \, Monome layout \, Auto-Load Set \, last set loaded \, and
Auto-Set Prefix. THESE SETTINGS WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE APPLIED ON SUBSEQUENT
LAUNCH OF PD_MLR.;
#X text 20 584 mlr_help - Click this box to open up pd_mlr documentation.
;
#X text 20 262 Sample Set save / load - Click to save current sample
set or load previously saved sample set \, including 1) for each sample
row: audio file paths \, group assignment \, beats and speed. 2) for
each pattern recorder: recording length in beats and Button press or
Audio mode. 3) general configuration settings: BPM \, Std Beats \,
Quantize \, MicroFade \, Monome layout and mixer settings.;
#X text -370 299 To begin recording \, tap the recorder button once.
Recorder LED will light without blinking. Recording begins with next
button press. Recording ends the specified number of beats later.;
#X text -370 427 To reset in a pattern recorder position already loaded
\, tap the pattern recorder button twice quickly \, and the LED will
go off \, indicating readiness to record. As above \, tap once to enter
record mode.;
#X text -370 604 In audio mode \, while recording still begins with
the first button press following record mode \, all audio playing will
be recorded as an audio file \, stopping after the selected number
of beats. Playback begins automatically \, but is playing back the
recorded audio file and is independent of buttons pressed thereafter
on the monome.;
